This project uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, I will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”

(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption):

1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

The overall goal is to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007
